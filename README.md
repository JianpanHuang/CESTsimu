## Abstract

**CESTsimu** is a CEST simulation tool with a GUI for intuitively simulating spectral (1D Z-spectra) and spatial (2D phantom) data. CESTsimu has potential to broaden the utilization of CEST MRI among diverse users. It consists of three modules: **Saturation settings**, **Exchange settings**, and **Phantom settings**. CESTsimu can not only import/export files in the defined format but can also import files generated by other existing simulation platform (pulseq-CEST). CESTsimu has potential to facilitate the broad utilization of CEST MRI among diverse users.

## Installation and use

- CESTsimu is developed using MATLAB 2023a, so if your version of MATLAB is earlier than 2023a, please update your MATLAB.
- In MATLAB, navigate to the CESTsimu folder, open **CESTsimu.mlappinstall** and install. Then you will find CESTsimu in the "Apps" tab, in the "My apps" group. Click on it to execute the app.
